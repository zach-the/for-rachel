### Possible Trajectories
*PS: I would really like if you told me that whatever plan you have to ponder this stuff before you enact it, especially if that plan involves significantly throttling communication or contact with me.*

Anyways here are kinda the three options:
1. We're finished
2. You keep seeing other guys, and we also keep seeing each other (I think you should still at least consider this option, if not only for another week or two, and maybe just less agressively than you did last week.)
3. We start dating, with no preconcieved notion of how anything will play out

### Potential Places for Poor Vision
##### Zach is leaving Soon
It's kinda painful to say this, but if I were your big brother, the thing I would honestly be telling you is to consider the fact that I only have two months left in Provo, which for a lot of people is considered the best place to get married. You should be careful that you're not getting into a relationship with someone who just wants *a relationship*, not a relationship **with you**.

##### 2 Months
We really only have two months to have an in-person relationship. That's not a ton of time to really get to know someone, and to try to make any sort of big decision in that amount of time would probably be unwise. There are some downsides there, but I don't know if that's something worth considering at this moment, as much as it might be, say a month from now. 

Another thing that I'll add here is that I'll be making $95000 a year on salary alone, and round trip flights from Denver to SLC are only $100. So I think if it came to it I'd very likely be seeing you 2-3 days out of the week (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) on a weekly basis.

##### Thoughts on Long-Distance
Long distance relationships are hard. I don't know if it would make much sense to expect to be long distance for a period of time greater than 6-12 months.

### Things Rachel Should Consider / Rachel Should make Judgement Calls On Probably
##### My Take on the Essence of the Dilemma
It seems to me that the big challenge of all of this is that to date me in any sort of committed relationship means to look straight into the eyes of a future that is pretty different than the one that you had previously imagined for yourself and to say, "that might happen." Which is pretty terrifying. If you're anything like me, you probably looked forward to the idea of going to BYU and graduating from BYU with a lot of excitement and anticipation, and to consider not doing that is a big deal. So I think it kind of comes down to whether or not you're willing to risk that preconcieved notion of how your future would play out, or not. ***And it's okay if you're not***
##### You're Totally Capable of Finding More Guys
Another thing that comes along with this idea of the future is that I do honestly believe that you'd be able to find someone else. I don't know where you stand on this, but I am not a huge believer in the idea of soul mates. (I know, how unromantic). Anyways, I can see that you're just a wonderful woman, and that for someone as awesome as you are, it wouldn't be particularly challenging for you to find someone else who can "check all your boxes." Like literally, you could make a list and bring that list to each first date you go on, and eventually you would find a guy who likes you and who checks every box. And that would probably happen for you a couple of times while you're at BYU, if you just decided to keep going on dates. So while I think there are some things that I can bring to the table that would be very very challenging to find in other guys, there are definitely other guys out there who could make you the happiest girl in the world.
##### A Note on Flaws
Something my Dad said to me, that I think a lot about is this: "Every one has flaws. It's just a matter of finding someone whose flaws you can live with." I would encourage you to think honestly about what flaws and shortcomings I have, and to ask yourself if are things that you're okay with. If you'd like, we can talk about my problems in a more open and up-front way later, but I feel like I've brought most of the major red flags that I might have, and some of my smaller weaknesses up with you by now.
##### Loyalty and Commitment
I can understand what your roomate is saying about you dating other guys and basically being in a relationship with me and whatnot, but at the same time, there was a pretty clear agreement that we had both negotiated and agreed to, and I feel like most of that was because we both understood the [essence of the dilemma]{#My Take on the Essence of the Dilemma}.


### Final Notes from Zach
- consider the other dude
- whatever happens is what is supposed to happen. i trust that fully. i trust you to make the right decision for you. that's the only way that both of us can be happy

##### Validation About Your Situation

##### Notes about how to 'let go'
One of your first questions tonight to me was about how to 'let go'. I talked about it from the perspective of my experiences with relation to Sydne. That was particularly hard because for a long time (like, the better part of two years), I had basically expected and planned on dating Sydne, before I finally broke up with her for good. But even before that, I had a whole host of experiences that led to me breaking off the engagement, about 6 months previous to break of the engagement.

### Miscellaneous thoughts, to be integrated
- notes on loyalty : she does not have to be loyal to me. 
- "afraid to risk the preconcieved notion of how her future would play out"
