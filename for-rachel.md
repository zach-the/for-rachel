### Possible Trajectories
Anyways here are kinda the three options:
> 1. We're finished
> 2. You keep seeing other guys, and we also keep seeing each other (I think you should still at least consider this option, even if only for another week or two, and maybe just less agressively than you did last week.)
> 3. We start dating, with no preconcieved notion of how anything will play out

### Some Facts About Our Situation, and Their Respective Implications
##### I'm Leaving Soon
It's scary to say this, but if I were your big brother, the thing I would honestly be telling you is to consider the fact that I only have two months left in Provo. I would tell you that you should be careful that you're not getting into a relationship with someone who just wants **a relationship**, not a relationship **with you**, which might be a risk if you're dating someone who is leaving Provo so soon.

##### I Haven't Been on a Ton of Dates
This is another one that is a little scary to admit and to tell you to honestly consider, but I have not been on that many dates. You were the first girl I took on a date after I broke up with Sydne for good, and between my mission and dating Sydne there wasn't a ton of dating around that I had done (maybe 5 or 6 dates and a month-long relationship). So big brother to little sister again, you should think about that.

##### 2 Months
We really only have two months to have an in-person relationship. That's not a ton of time to really get to know someone, and to try to make any sort of big decision in that amount of time would probably be unwise. There are some downsides there, but I don't know if that's something worth considering at this moment, as much as it might be, say a month from now. 

Another thing that I'll add here is that I'll be making $95k a year not including bonuses or stock options, and round trip flights from Denver to SLC are only $100. So I think if it came to it I'd very likely be seeing you 2-3 days out of the week (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) on a weekly basis. An anecdotal fact to back this up is when I was in Idaho last summer for my internship there were only two weeks out of the twelve that I didn't do the 5.5 hour drive from Boise to Provo to see Sydne. So I guess that is a promise of sorts that you could count on. 

### Things You Consider and Make Judgement Calls On Probably
##### Loyalty and Commitment
I can understand what your roomate is saying about you dating other guys and basically being in a relationship with me and whatnot, but at the same time, there was a pretty clear agreement that we had both negotiated and agreed to, and I feel like most of that was because we both understood the stakes of what a relationship with me would mean for you, from the beginning.

The absolute last thing that I want you to do is to get yourself into a situation where you feel trapped because of the ideas captured in these sentences:
- maybe somebody else, so not him I guess
- probably nobody else, and therefore him

Ultimately, I hope that the basis of your decision for **whoever** you decide to get into relationships with are as follows...
- him, so definitely nobody else

...and that your basis for ending those relationships is:
- not him, so definitely somebody else.

Also, remember this quote that my friend said to me: *"in a relationship, everything is great until it's not."* That means that choosing to date me is **not** choosing to marry me. That's the point. At any point in the relationship, you could learn or experience something that totally changes the way you feel, and at that point, you're **obligated** to end the relationship. And that is in no way unfair. That's exactly how it's supposed to be. Once you're married, of course, it's a different story. But yeah.

##### My Take on the Essence of the Dilemma
The main problem seems to be this: To date me in any sort of committed relationship probably means to look straight into the eyes of a future that is pretty different than the one that you had previously imagined for yourself and to say, "that might happen." Which is pretty terrifying. If you're anything like me, you probably looked forward to the idea of going to BYU and graduating from BYU with a lot of excitement and anticipation, and to entertain the possibility of not doing that is a big deal. So I think it kind of comes down to whether or not you're willing to risk that preconcieved notion of how your future would play out, or not. ***And it's okay if you're not***

##### You're Totally Capable of Finding More Guys
Another thing that comes along with this idea of the future is that I do honestly believe that you'd be able to find someone else. I don't know where you stand on this, but I am not a huge believer in the idea of soul mates. (I know, how unromantic). Anyways, I can see that you're just a wonderful woman, and that for someone as awesome as you are, it wouldn't be particularly challenging for you to find someone else who can "check all your boxes." Like literally, you could make a list and bring that list to each first date you go on, and eventually you would find a guy who likes you and who checks every box. And that would probably happen for you a couple of times while you're at BYU, if you just decided to keep going on dates. So while I think there are some things that I can bring to the table that would be very very challenging to find in other guys, there are definitely other guys out there who could make you the happiest girl in the world.

##### A Note on Flaws
Something my Dad said to me, that I think a lot about is this: "Every one has flaws. It's just a matter of finding someone whose flaws you can live with." I would encourage you to think honestly about what flaws and shortcomings I have, and to ask yourself if there are things that you're okay with. I feel like I've brought all of the major red flags that I might have with you by now but if you'd like, we can talk about my flaws and weaknesses in a more open and up-front way later.

### My Final Thoughts
##### The Other Guy
I know you briefly mentioned that you went on a second date with another guy, and that you had a lot of fun - I think that's awesome. It's kinda painful to say this, and I don't really want to, but once again, if I were you big brother, I would tell you to go on a few more dates with him, and see how it goes. You gotta look out for \#1 here, and make the most selfish decision. Here's why: I would never want to date or marry someone who I think might have wanted someone else more than me. So just be sure that that's absolutely not the case before you do anything.

##### Validation About Your Situation
It's a tough situation to be in. I absolutely do not envy you. I really just wanna be patient and like, supportive I guess. I want to teach you everything that I can that I know from the mistakes I've made and the painful experiences I've had when it comes to tough relationship and life decisions. 

##### Notes About How To 'Let Go'
One of your first questions tonight to me was about how to 'let go'. Honestly, the first thing that came to mind when you asked me that was [this clip from Dune lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw71Ex7Z77g&t=64s). I love this scene because he can see what's necessary for him to get to where he's trying to go, and it literally requires letting go of the controls. I think that's honestly a lot of what it takes. In my personal experience, God is pretty quick at revealing to me what is that I need to do, or at least in giving me information and guidance about how to approach decisions. For me, most of the challenge is the 'letting go' that comes after the revelation that has been received. That's the ultimate 
expression of trust, and when you do that, God really takes care of you. It is scary though. 

In the case I was telling you about where I was struggling about what to do with Sydne, it took me honestly admitting to myself that I felt that there was just something fundamentally wrong about the way that I felt about the relationship, and that after all the work I had put in to change the way that I felt, to change the way that our relationship functioned, and after truly significant and amicable progress on all fronts, I still felt just unsettled. It was at that point that I decided that the way I felt must have been from God, and so I decided to let go. From that point, because I was certain that that feeling of doubt and hesitation was from God, and was not anxiety and doubt, I had zero doubt in my mind that what I was doing was correct. 

So I think the biggest point is just to be honest with yourself about what you feel, and about the sources of those feelings. Just admit to yourself what you honestly feel, and allow yourself to see what that actually means. After that, you can trust that God will direct you about where to go.

##### Trust God
Whatever happens is what is supposed to happen. I trust that fully. I trust you to receive your own revelation and to make the right decision for you. I know that God has a fantastic plan in store for the both of us, so I'm not too worried about it. I also know that I have approached this relationship in exactly the way that God wanted me to.

##### From Me to You
Rachel, I just think you're really awesome - you're funny, intelligent, faithful, hard-working, ambitious, kind, really fun to be around, friendly, happy, reasonable, and beautiful. I care about you so much, and I just love spending time with you. Like, a lot. I really hope this works out, because I would be really happy if it did.

*PS: I would really like if you told me whatever plan you have to ponder this stuff before you enact it, especially if that plan involves, like, cutting me off or something.*

*PPS: I really like you :)*
