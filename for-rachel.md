#### Possible Trajectories
- The non-negotiable with all of these is that you take time to ponder these decisions thoroughly, and I would really like if you told me that plan before you enact it, especially if that plan involves significantly throttling communication or contact with me
1. We're finished
2. You keep seeing other guys, and we also keep seeing each other
3. We start dating, with no preconcieved notion of how anything will play out

#### Notes about how to 'let go'
One of your first questions tonight to me was about how to 'let go'. I talked about it from the perspective of my experiences with relation to Sydne. That was particularly hard because for a long time (like, the better part of two years), I had basically expected and planned on dating Sydne, before I finally broke up with her for good. But even before that, I had a whole host of experiences that led to me breaking off the engagement, about 6 months previous to break of the engagement.

#### Final Notes from Zach
- consider the other dude
- whatever happens is what is supposed to happen. i trust that fully. i trust you to make the right decision for you. that's the only way that both of us can be happy

#### Miscellaneous thoughts, to be integrated
- notes on loyalty : she does not have to be loyal to me. 
- "afraid to risk the preconcieved notion of how her future would play out"
